  <p class="center w-50 mt4">
    Even in the 'good' version of our app we have a couple of vulnerabilities.
    ZAP will not pick these up, but they are there - a good example of why you
    need to know a little about common issues, and not rely only on automated
    tools.
  </p>
  <p class="center w-50 mt4">
    In addition to these vulnerbailities, this version of the app will show some
    ZAP alerts if you scan it.
  </p>
  <p class="center w-50 mt4">
    These are 'Cookie No HttpOnly Flag' and 'Cookie without Secure Flag'.
    They relate to the 'sessionid' cookie on the log out page. They occur because
    when Django logs a user out, the sessionid cookie is replaced with an empty
    string, and has no flags set. This isn't a security problem (see the explanation
    <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/33787443' class='link dim'>here</a>).
  </p>
  <p class="center w-50 mt4">
    You may also come across alerts for SQL injection. We've tried our best to
    exploit this, but it seems to us it is a false positive. If you can figure
    it out, let us know!
